* Interact with External Schemes from within Edwin

** Usage

This repository contains two Edwin modes, External Scheme mode and
External Scheme REPL mode.

External Scheme REPL mode allows you to interact with an external
Scheme REPL's process from Edwin in the same way you would interact
with a shell using `#\M-x shell'. Load the file
`external-scheme-repl.scm' and enter the command `#\M-x
external-scheme-repl'. You'll be asked to enter the name of the
external Scheme you'd like to run, and away you go.

External Scheme mode inherits from Edwin's Scheme mode for all of its
formatting and editing commands, but provides its own commands for
sending expressions to a running external Scheme REPL, if one exists.

Load the file `external-scheme-mode.scm' and enter the command `#\M-x
external-scheme-mode' in a buffer containing Scheme code that you want
to send to the external Scheme. Right now you can run only one
external Scheme REPL, so be sure that the code you're sending is going
to be understood by that Scheme.

** Caveats

Right now you may run only one external Scheme REPL at a time. Any
Scheme buffers in External Scheme mode will send their eval'd code to
that REPL.

Finally, note that files containing Scheme code are automatically
opened by Edwin in its own Scheme mode, no matter what Scheme they're
written in, so you'll need to do `#\M-x external-scheme-mode'.
